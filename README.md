Description: Using content generated by R's MANOVA function, creates high precision power and p-values for the Wilks Lambda Statistic 
using the Butler/Wood Algorithm (Butler, R.W. and Wood, A.T.A."Approximation of Power in Multivariate Analysis" in Statistics and Computing Vol. 15,pp. 281-287,2005 <doi:10.1007/s11222-005-4071-x>).In addition provides an S4 object that computes these same
statistics useful in evaluating multiple dependent variables models created by other R programs. In a second and third part, computes the 
likelihood ratio statistic for block independence and equivalence of covariance matricies along with p-values using other Butler/Wood methods.	
This github repository also contains a PDF of Butler/Wood 2005. In addition a tar.gz which can be downloaded to separately install the R package from a local file without using the usual method on the R GUI, that is,  devtools::install_github("chvrngit/wmpvaer").
