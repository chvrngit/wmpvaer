# wmpvaer ver. 1.1
Description ver(1.0): Using content generated by R's MANOVA function, creates high precision power and p-values for the Wilks Lambda Statistic using the Butler/Wood Algorithm (Butler, R.W. and Wood, A.T.A."Approximation of Power in Multivariate Analysis" in Statistics and Computing Vol. 15,pp. 281-287,2005 <doi:10.1007/s11222-005-4071-x>).In addition provides an S4 object that computes these same
statistics useful in evaluating multiple dependent variables models created by other R programs. In a second and third part, computes the 
likelihood ratio statistic for block independence and equivalence of covariance matricies along with p-values using other Butler/Wood methods.	

Description ver(1.1) adds the following sentence:  In a fourth part, computes a sample size estimate for 1-way MANOVA using the Wilks Lambda statistic and Butler/Wood algorithm. 

This github repository also contains a PDF of Butler/Wood 2005. In addition a tar.gz which can be downloaded to separately install the R package from a local file without using the devtools program with the R GUI (that is, >devtools::install_github("chvrngit/wmpvaer)).

To tell you the truth just downloading the tar.gz file is alot faster than using devtools and install_github. But remember if you go the devtools and install_github route ,and want the vignette, you have to use >devtools::install_github("chvrngit/wmpvaer",build_vignettes=TRUE) instead and use >vignette("wmpvaerV", "wmpvaer") to view the vignette created.


JUST WANT THE VIGNETTE? YOU ARE IN LUCK- YOU DON'T HAVE TO CREATE A COPY OF IT YOURSELF.
I have also included a file "wmpvaerVpdf.pdf" in this github repository. It contains the PDF vignette.
